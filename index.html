<h2><pre><i>The Author J.Clear in this book explains the importance of strengthening the foundation of life in order to achieve greater hights. 
We as human usually focus on the greater aspects of life which we fail to see that happiness and success can only be achieved by the small small habits 
and behaviours we develope and maintain them all together our lives as human beings. However please note whatever the author states in this book cant't 
be developed overnight since it is an exercise which needs to be repeated daily for years and only than you'll be able to note the changes within you
aswell around you. 
so people who believe in changes happening within a snap of their fingers please stay away from this book, it ain't your cup of coffee.</i></pre></h2>
